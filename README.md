# Crypto_Prices
A very small Vue.Js app that pulls data from the cryptocompare.com API and displays the data in a searchable Vuetify table.

The relevant get request is made using Axios.

Notes: 
- Not all files have been uploaded to allow this app to work.
- The API request is handled in the front-end, so the API key has been removed.
- Data comes from the CryptoCompare.com API.  You can access this at https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ where you can get your own API key.

- I am not a Financial Advisor.  This app was only for practice working with API's.
